## This is the project source code for COS30049 - Computing Technology Innovation Project.

New version to merge to master.

Add another thing to demonstrate merging.

1 Project Description
The project description provides an overview of the background and essential requirements for three different projects: 1) smart contract audit system 2) decentralized trading system and 3) blockchain transaction information visualization system. Students are supposed to validate the project requirements with their clients (workshop tutors). Students should collaboratively discuss in their group and transform these requirements into corresponding documentation and practical code functions. Additionally, students have the opportunity to propose and integrate further enhancements into the system, which can be reflected in the final design.

The Decentralized Trading System aims to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for peer-to-peer trading of digital assets without the need for intermediaries. The system's primary goal is to enable seamless, trustless, and transparent transactions, enhancing the overall trading experience for users within the blockchain ecosystem.

Note: in this system, students don’t need to implement the payment gateway.

Core Functional Requirements:

Users can view digital assets available for trading.
All the listed digital assets information should be stored in the database.
The system should provide a search and filter functionality for users to discover specific assets of interest.
The website will implement smart contracts to act as escrow during the trading process, and smart contracts should ensure that assets are held securely until the trade is completed or canceled.
Users should have access to a transaction history to view their past trades.
2 Submission
You must submit your assignment via the assignment submission link (i.e.,  “Assignment 1 Submission”) on the Canvas site by the deadline specified in Section 1 (Friday, 02/09/2023, 5:30 pm).

There will be NO hard copy submission required for this assignment.
You are required to submit your assignment as a .zip file named with your group number. For example, if your group number is “group 1-23”, you would submit a  zipped file named “group 1-23.zip”.
Do not include any unnecessary file in this folder
Note that marks will be deducted if this requirement is not strictly complied
No submission accepted via email.
3 Deliverables
Your submission should contain the following files:

Static Website Source Code: A zipped file for the static front-end source code (e.g., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files)

Project Design Document: A comprehensive project design report that details:

Project background and introduction
Team introduction
Project requirement list and description
You should demonstrate the understanding of the given system requirements
Project design
front-end prototype, e.g., sketches on paper, hand-drawn sketches on an iPad, and design drawings on a design platform (e.g., Axure, Sketch)
overall system architecture design
Contribution Form: A form includes sections for the personal information of each team member, details of the contribution, and other additional information. You can download the form here Download here.

Important Notes:

Please be careful to ensure you do not publicly post anything which includes your reasoning, logic or any part of your work to the Canvas discussion, doing so violates Swinburne plagiarism/ collusion rules and has significant academic penalties. Use email to your allocated tutor to raise questions that may reveal part of your reasoning or solution.
In this Assessment, you must NOT use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to generate any materials or content in relation to the assessment task.
4 Marking Criteria
Part 1: Static Website Source Code (zip file):

Commenting your code is essential as part of the assessment criteria (refer to Marking  rubrics). You should also include comments at the beginning of your program file, which specify  your name, your Student ID, and in-line comments within the  program.

Part 2: Design Document

The length of the report should be at least 800 words (excluding references). You must acknowledge all statements and information taken from other sources and adhere to the guidelines published regarding plagiarism. All ideas and material taken from references must be cited within the report itself and a full reference list and bibliography (if appropriate) must be provided at the end of the report. Diagrams and/or tables may be used if you think this will strengthen your arguments. Remember that diagrams and tables adapted from other sources must be cited (Harvard style) as well.

This assignment is worth 30% of your total mark. You must demonstrate that you:

Can understand the requirements of the corresponding projects and
Identify the design elements needed to display on the web system.
Are able to design a user-friendly prototype and web system.
Can use the appropriate techniques (e.g., React.js) to implement the system front-end (static).
